an operating system
-------------------------
THE MAN IN THE ARENA
It is not the critic who counts; 
not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; 
who errs, who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, 
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

A few months ago, I started a project which named HelloOS, and I was trying to learn something about operating system
through the development of HelloOS, I dropped out from the project in the middle way, I was defeated, today I start it 
again,and I hope Roosevelt's words will encourage me to finish the project and prensent a simple operating system to 
anyone who wants to learn operating system but never finds a good practical one to start with.
